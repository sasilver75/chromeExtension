      <div id="innerText">Biology is the natural science that studies life and living organisms, including their
        physical structure, chemical processes, molecular interactions, physiological mechanisms, development and
        evolution.[1] Despite the complexity of the science, there are certain unifying concepts that consolidate it
        into a single,
        coherent field. Biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and
        evolution as the engine that propels the creation and extinction of species. Living organisms are open systems
        that survive by transforming energy and decreasing their local entropy[2] to maintain a stable and vital
        condition defined as homeostasis.</div>
