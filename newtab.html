          <div id="promptText">Translation requires some specialized equipment. Just as you wouldn't go to play
            tennis without your racket and ball, so a cell couldn't translate an mRNA into a protein without two pieces
            of molecular gear: ribosomes and tRNAs.
            Ribosomes provid structure in which translation can take place. They also catalyze the reaction that
            links amino acids to make a new protein.
            tRNAs (transfer RNAs) carry amino acids to the ribosome. They act as "bridges," matching a codon in an mRNA
            with the amino acid it codes for.</div>

        <p class="answerText">A ribosome is made up of two basic pieces: a large and a small subunit. During
          translation, the two subunits
          come together around a mRNA molecule, forming a complete ribosome. The ribosome moves forward on the mRNA,
          codon by codon, as it is read and translated into a polypeptide (protein chain). Then, once translation is
          finished, the two pieces come apart again and can be reused.</p>
