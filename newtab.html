          <div id="innerTextFront">Biology is the natural science that studies life and living organisms, including
            their
            physical structure, chemical processes, molecular interactions, physiological mechanisms, development and
            evolution.[1] Despite the complexity of the science, there are certain unifying concepts that consolidate it
            into a single,
            coherent field. Biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity,
            and
            evolution as the engine that propels the creation and extinction of species. Living organisms are open
            systems
            that survive by transforming energy and decreasing their local entropy[2] to maintain a stable and vital
            condition defined as homeostasis.</div>

          <div id="innerTextFront">Translation requires some specialized equipment. Just as you wouldn't go to play
            tennis without your racket and ball, so a cell couldn't translate an mRNA into a protein without two pieces
            of molecular gear: ribosomes and tRNAs.
            Ribosomes provid structure in which translation can take place. They also catalyze the reaction that
            links amino acids to make a new protein.
            tRNAs (transfer RNAs) carry amino acids to the ribosome. They act as "bridges," matching a codon in an mRNA
            with the amino acid it codes for.</div>

        <h1>Answer</h1>
        <p>A ribosome is made up of two basic pieces: a large and a small subunit. During translation, the two subunits
          come together around a mRNA molecule, forming a complete ribosome. The ribosome moves forward on the mRNA,
          codon by codon, as it is read and translated into a polypeptide (protein chain). Then, once translation is
          finished, the two pieces come apart again and can be reused.</p>
